This repository hosts a Google Colab notebook focused on predicting diamond prices based on their carat weight.  Leveraging a publicly available diamond dataset, the notebook walks through a typical machine learning workflow.  It begins with data loading and preprocessing, including handling missing values and exploring the relationships between carat and price through visualizations.  The core of the notebook involves training and evaluating regression models to predict diamond prices based on carat weight, and potentially other features if the dataset includes them.  The code is designed to be clear and well-commented, making it easy to follow the steps and understand the underlying concepts.

The Colab environment makes this project accessible to anyone with a Google account, eliminating the need for complex local setup.  Users can directly run the notebook, experiment with different models or data transformations, and immediately see the results.  The repository includes a README file that provides a brief overview of the project, describes the dataset used, and explains how to use the notebook.  This repository serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to a real-world problem, offering a valuable learning resource for those interested in data analysis, regression modeling, and the factors influencing diamond pricing.
